When we start the notice mode we should read in the notice file that is associated with this notice mode.
Read in the file and create all the objects.  They should be zones that react when clicked.

After the user clicks on something check if all the zones have been clicked.  If all the zones have been clicked we are ready for the next scene.

The notice file name:  nX.txt //X is just a number.
When a zone is clicked, it will call the script name.  We should name them nX_[Name] to keep things clean.
