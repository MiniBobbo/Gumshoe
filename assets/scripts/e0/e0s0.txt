Order:Why won't you move?  I feel like I've been here for an eternity.  
Chaos:We are immortal beings.  We have been here for an eternity.
Order:...
Order:Fair enough.  But why is THIS move taking so long?
>Wait:1000
>Animate:Chaos,smile
Chaos:I forget how the horses move.
>Animate:Order,facepalm
Order:Seriously?  
>Animate:Chaos,shrug
Chaos:Hey, I'm the embodiment of chaos.  Rules really aren't my thing.
Order:Fine. I'll wait.

Chaos:There. Anger takes Justice.  
Order:...
>Animate:Order,facepalm
Order:That's a good move.  
>Animate:Order,stand
>Animate:Chaos,smile
Chaos:It was, wasn't it?
Order:...Sigh...
Order:I hate creating new avatars of Justice.  It takes a century to get them working right.
>Animate:Chaos,stand
Chaos:So play without one.  
Order:The rules state I always need an Avatar of Justice.  Besides, you know what would happen down there without an Avatar of Justice?
Chaos:Heh.
Order:Right, I forgot who I was talking to for a minute.  Fine, let's go.
Chaos:What?
Order:If I need to go recruit you are coming with me.
>Animate:Chaos,shrug
Chaos:Aaawwww... Why do I have to come?  You lost your stupid avatar.
>Animate:Chaos,stand
Order:You killed my stupid avatar.  Besides, I can't leave you up here alone with the board.  You'd cheat.
>Animate:Chaos,smile
Chaos:Heh... I probably would.
Chaos:Can we stop for ice cream while we are down there?  
Order:Last time we got ice cream you almost made me sick.
>Animate:Chaos,stand
Chaos:..?
Order:Chocolate ice cream with pizza flavored gelato?
Chaos:I am what I am.
Order:Fine. Let's go.
